# adjlc920 - v4l2-ctl simple setup for logitech c920 for octoprint use. iterate through array
#            to execute the commands vcmd[]. If there is an error, log the error in
#            syslog and quit. If all commands execute print success in syslog. I run it
#            on reboot in rc.local but you can run it from the terminal if you wish
#
#            this will work for any camera. the controls will vary based on the cam. use
#            v4l2-ctl -l to list the controls you can adjust
#
# CAUTION:   this will exit your rc.local script if it fails. place it cautiously
