probe_nozzle_x: 183.0 ;244.5
probe_nozzle_y: 380.0 ; 329.0 
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the
#   Z endstop.
probe_switch_x: 177.0 ;240.5
probe_switch_y: 360.0 ;281.5
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch
#   on the Z endstop.
probe_bed_x: 184.0
probe_bed_y: 200.0
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.
switch_offset: 0.355
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
max_deviation: 1.5
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
samples: 6
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance: 0.005
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance_retries: 10
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: median
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 5
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
position_min: -5
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 300
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
lift_speed: 20
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
probing_speed: 15
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: 3
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: 2.5
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: true
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
